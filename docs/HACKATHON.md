### Title
**Verified AI Resume & Degree Checker: Government-Grade Fraud Detection on Flare Network**

### Tagline
*"Stopping fake degrees, fabricated resumes, and identity fraud with blockchain-powered AI verification"*

### Problem Statement

Academic and professional credential fraud is a $2.3 billion global problem. Fake degrees, fabricated work experience, and identity impersonation undermine trust in hiring processes, government services, and professional licensing. Current verification methods are:
- Slow and manual
- Expensive to scale
- Vulnerable to document tampering
- Lack cryptographic proof
- Difficult to audit

### Solution

We built a **tamper-proof, blockchain-powered verification system** on Flare Network that:
- ✅ Uses AI to detect fraud indicators and inconsistencies
- ✅ Verifies credentials against government databases via FDC (Flare Data Connector)
- ✅ Timestamps all verifications with FTSO (Flare Time Series Oracle)
- ✅ Issues verifiable attestation NFTs
- ✅ Wraps credentials as FAssets for portability
- ✅ Enables government multi-signature approval via Smart Accounts

### Flare Network Technologies Used

1. **FAssets (Fungible Assets)**: Wrap verified credentials as transferable assets
2. **FDC (Flare Data Connector)**: Cryptographically provable off-chain data verification
3. **FTSO (Flare Time Series Oracle)**: Tamper-proof timestamping
4. **Flare Smart Accounts**: Multi-signature, role-based attestation minting

### Key Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: GPT-4/Claude detects inconsistencies and fraud patterns
- **Blockchain Verification**: On-chain storage of evidence hashes
- **Government Integration**: Multi-sig approval for official attestations
- **Employer Tools**: Instant QR code scanning and NFT verification
- **Immutable Audit Trail**: All actions recorded on Flare blockchain

### Impact

- **For Governments**: Reduce fraud, streamline verification, enable digital credentials
- **For Employers**: Instant verification, reduce hiring costs, prevent bad hires
- **For Candidates**: Portable credentials, fraud protection, career opportunities
- **For Society**: Increase trust, reduce fraud, enable merit-based systems

### Technical Highlights

- **Smart Contracts**: 4 Solidity contracts (Registry, NFT, FAsset Wrapper, Smart Account)
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with AI pipeline and Flare integration
- **Frontend**: React with MetaMask/Flare wallet integration
- **Security**: Multi-signature, role-based access, cryptographic proofs

### What's Next

- Production deployment on Flare Mainnet
- Integration with more government databases
- Mobile app for candidates
- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy
- Cross-chain credential portability
